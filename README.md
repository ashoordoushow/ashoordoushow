# 🌱 Hi, my name is Ashoor! 🌱


<p style="background-color:gray; color:white; font-style:italic; padding:5px 10px; margin: 0; text-align:center;">Today's good mood is sponsored by coffee ☕️</p>

Hello everyone, I'm Ashoor, a Full-Stack Web Developer | Junior Software Engineer, who brings a unique blend of analytical thinking and creative problem-solving to web development. Fresh from completing an intensive coding bootcamp at Actualize, I've mastered full-stack development using JavaScript, React.js, Ruby on Rails, SQL, and many more languages/frameworks, while gaining hands-on experience building real-world applications.

## A bit more about me...

I'm an Assyrian American, based in Chicago. I have an adorable dog, a passion for sports/basketball, and love spontaneous experiences. Although I love spontaneity and can be fairly extroverted, I'm naturally a homebody who thrives best in comfortable silence :).
